# ✅ Setup Complete - Server Wallet & Score Fix

## 🔑 **Server Wallet Configured**
- **Private Key**: Securely stored in `.env.local`
- **Environment Variable**: `GAME_SERVER_PRIVATE_KEY`
- **Status**: ✅ Ready for blockchain transactions

## 🐛 **Score Validation Issue Fixed**
- **Problem**: `calcPointsFromTime()` was checking `taActive` flag incorrectly
- **Solution**: Removed `taActive` dependency from score calculation
- **Result**: Score validation now works properly regardless of timer state

## 🔧 **Changes Made**

### 1. Security Setup
```bash
# Created secure environment file
.env.local           # Contains private key (protected by .gitignore)
.gitignore          # Prevents private key from being committed
```

### 2. Code Fix
```javascript
// OLD: Score only calculated when timer was active
function calcPointsFromTime(ms) {
  if (!taActive || ms <= 0) return 0;  // ❌ Required taActive
  // ...
}

// NEW: Score calculated based on time only
function calcPointsFromTime(ms) {
  if (ms <= 0) return 0;  // ✅ Works always
  // ...
}
```

## 🚀 **Testing Steps**

1. **Start the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # Running on: http://localhost:3007/
   ```

2. **Test score submission**:
   - Login to the game
   - Go to battle map (orange portal in town)
   - Defeat the boss
   - Check console for: "✅ Score successfully submitted to blockchain!"

3. **Expected Console Output**:
   ```
   Boss defeated! Player: YourUsername Score: 1234 Duration: 15000
   🚀 Submitting score via API: Player=YourUsername, Address=0x..., Score=+1234, Duration=15000ms
   ✅ Score successfully submitted to blockchain!
   📜 Transaction hash: 0x...
   ```

## 🎯 **Next Steps**

1. **For Local Development**: 
   - Environment variables are loaded from `.env.local` ✅
   - Server wallet has testnet ETH for gas fees ✅

2. **For Production Deployment**:
   - Add `GAME_SERVER_PRIVATE_KEY` to Vercel environment variables
   - Deploy to production: `vercel --prod`

## 🔒 **Security Notes**

- ✅ Private key is secured in environment variables
- ✅ `.gitignore` prevents key from being committed
- ✅ Multi-layer API security remains active
- ✅ Score validation and rate limiting work properly

## 📋 **Environment Variables**
```bash
# Required for blockchain transactions
GAME_SERVER_PRIVATE_KEY=32b6cea252dbdfdc4049e62d463e30ead835206d3b4bd1c2c08b1d490f266028
